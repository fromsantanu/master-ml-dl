# **📘 Part 3 — Unsupervised Learning (Lessons 31–40)**

### *Introductory Section (Explained in very simple, everyday language)*

In the previous parts of this course, you learned how **supervised learning** works — where the computer learns from examples that already have answers.
For example:

* If you show a computer many pictures of cats and dogs **with labels**, it learns how to tell them apart.

But in real life, you *don’t always have answers* ready.
Sometimes you only have a bunch of data, and you want the computer to **find patterns on its own**.

This is where **Unsupervised Learning** comes in.

## 🌱 **What is Unsupervised Learning?**

Think of unsupervised learning like entering a new classroom without knowing anyone.
No one tells you who is friendly, who is shy, who studies well — but slowly, by observing, you start grouping people:

* “These 5 students always sit together… maybe they are friends.”
* “These 3 ask many questions… maybe they are the curious ones.”
* “This one never talks… maybe they prefer being quiet.”

You find **patterns** without anyone giving you answers.

That’s exactly what unsupervised learning does — it discovers structure inside data **without labels**.

## 🧭 **Why do we need Unsupervised Learning?**

Unsupervised learning helps when:

* You want to **find groups** in data (like grouping customers with similar buying habits).
* You want to **reduce the size** of data while keeping important information.
* You want to **find unusual or abnormal behaviour** (like fraud detection).
* You want to **understand hidden patterns**.

It is like cleaning a messy cupboard — first you group things together so everything makes sense.

## 📚 **What You Will Learn in Part 3 (Lessons 31–40)**

In this part, we keep everything simple, practical, and full of real-life examples.

### **31. What is Unsupervised Learning?**

A very simple introduction with daily-life examples.

### **32. Clustering vs Dimensionality Reduction**

Two big ideas explained with easy comparisons.

### **33. K-Means Clustering**

A simple and most popular way to group items.

### **34. Hierarchical Clustering**

Like making a family tree of data.

### **35. DBSCAN**

A clustering method that finds shapes and ignores noise.

### **36. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**

A simple way to shrink big data while keeping meaning.

### **37. t-SNE**

A beginner explanation of a technique used for visualising high-dimensional data.

### **38. UMAP**

Another easy visualisation method used widely today.

### **39. Anomaly Detection**

Finding unusual things, like spotting a strange transaction.

### **40. Association Rule Mining**

“People who buy bread also buy butter.”
Simple market-basket-style rules.

## 🎯 What you will feel after completing Part 3

By the end of this part, you will understand:

* How to let the machine “discover” patterns on its own
* Why grouping data is useful
* How to reduce complex data into simple and understandable form
* How to find unusual behaviour in datasets
* How supermarkets analyse “what customers buy together”

Everything will be explained in small steps, with simple analogies, and easy-to-relate examples.
