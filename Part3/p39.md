# **Lesson 39: Anomaly Detection**

*(Explained in very simple, everyday language with practical examples)*

---

## 🌼 **1. What is Anomaly Detection?**

Anomaly detection is the process of finding **unusual**, **unexpected**, or **abnormal** data points.

Very simple meaning:
👉 **Anything that does not behave like the rest is an anomaly.**

Just like a teacher noticing one student behaving very differently from the class — that student becomes “unusual” or “odd” compared to the group.

In data, anomalies are points that “don’t fit” with the normal pattern.

---

## 🧒 **2. A very simple real-life example**

Imagine you check your monthly electricity bill:

* January: ₹800
* February: ₹780
* March: ₹820
* April: ₹9,500 ← This is an anomaly!

Something is wrong —
maybe the meter reading was faulty, or some device malfunctioned.

This one value is **far from the normal pattern**, so it’s an anomaly.

---

## 🌐 **3. Where do anomalies occur in real life?**

### ✔ Bank Transactions

If you normally spend ₹200–₹500 per transaction,
and suddenly there's a ₹50,000 withdrawal,
that is an anomaly → possible fraud.

### ✔ Medical Reports

If your heart rate suddenly spikes from 75 to 150 without reason,
that’s an anomaly → health risk.

### ✔ Website Traffic

If a site normally receives 200 visits per hour,
and suddenly it jumps to 20,000 visits,
this could be an attack or a viral trend.

### ✔ Manufacturing

If a machine normally runs at 60°C
and suddenly reaches 100°C,
it may be about to fail.

### ✔ Students’ marks

If a student always gets 85–90,
and suddenly gets 20 in one exam,
that is an anomaly.

In short:
👉 **Anomalies often mean something important is happening.**

---

## 🎯 **4. Why is Anomaly Detection useful?**

Anomalies usually indicate:

* Fraud
* Fault
* Error
* Risk
* Important event
* Unusual behaviour
* Unexpected change

Detecting anomalies early can:

✔ Prevent financial loss
✔ Save human lives
✔ Protect systems
✔ Improve product quality
✔ Avoid breakdowns

It’s like an early-warning system.

## 🧠 **5. How does anomaly detection work? (Very simple)**

The computer tries to learn:

👉 **“What does normal look like?”**

Once it understands normal patterns,
anything that does not follow those patterns is marked as **abnormal**.

There are three basic approaches:

---

### **A) Using Distance**

Points that are **far away** from the group are anomalies.

Example:
If everyone’s height is around 160–175 cm,
and someone is 220 cm,
that’s unusual.

---

### **B) Using Density**

Areas with **low density** (few points) are anomalies.

Example:
Imagine a playground:

* Most children are playing in groups
* One child is far away sitting alone → anomaly

DBSCAN (Lesson 35) uses this idea.

---

### **C) Using Prediction Errors**

If a model predicts something,
but the actual value is **very different**,
that point is an anomaly.

Example:
If the model predicts electricity bill = ₹900,
but actual bill = ₹8000
→ a big error → anomaly.

---

## 📦 **6. Types of Anomalies**

### ✔ **Point anomaly**

Only one point is unusual.
Example: suddenly spending ₹50,000.

### ✔ **Contextual anomaly**

Something is unusual only in a specific context.
Example:
Ice cream sales dropping to zero in summer → anomaly
Ice cream sales dropping in winter → normal

### ✔ **Collective anomaly**

A group of points together look unusual.
Example:
10 failed login attempts in 1 minute → possible hacking attempt.

## 🩺 **7. Real-World Examples in Different Domains**

### **1. Healthcare**

* Sudden change in heart rate
* Strange blood test values
* Unusual sleep patterns

### **2. Cybersecurity**

* Strange login times
* Unusual IP addresses
* High number of failed logins

### **3. Finance**

* Fraudulent credit card payments
* Suspicious loan applications

### **4. Manufacturing**

* Temperature spikes
* Machine vibration changes

### **5. Retail**

* Unusual buying pattern
* Sudden drop in sales

---

## 👍 **8. Strengths of Anomaly Detection**

* Helps in early warning
* Protects money, machines, and people
* Works without labels
* Very useful in real-world systems
* Can work with both small and large datasets

---

## 👎 **9. Weaknesses**

* Hard to define what is “normal”
* Sensitive to noise
* May give false alarms
* Some methods need tuning
* Can be affected by seasonal changes

Example:
High electricity usage may be normal in summer but anomaly in winter.

---

## ⭐ Final Takeaway

**Anomaly detection is all about finding unusual patterns that do not match normal behaviour.**
It is like spotting something strange in a crowd —
a powerful tool for detecting fraud, faults, health issues, and risks early.
