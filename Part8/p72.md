# **Lesson 72: Text Preprocessing**

*(Explained in very simple, everyday language)*

---

### **🌟 1. What is Text Preprocessing?**

Before a computer can understand text, we must **clean** it.

Think of raw text like unwashed vegetables.
Before cooking, you **wash**, **cut**, and **prepare** them.

Similarly, before feeding text to a machine learning model, we **clean**, **organize**, and **prepare** it so that the computer can understand it easily.

This cleaning process is called **text preprocessing**.

---

### **🌟 2. Why do we need to clean text?**

Because real text contains:

* punctuation
* extra spaces
* different letter cases (HELLO vs hello)
* emojis 🙂
* misspellings
* unnecessary words like “the”, “is”, “on”
* URLs (https://...)
* mobile numbers
* hashtags #
* user mentions @name

A computer gets confused with all this noise.

So preprocessing removes unnecessary things and keeps only useful information.

---

### **🌟 3. Common Text Preprocessing Steps**

Let’s go step-by-step in simple language.

---

### **✔ 1. Lowercasing**

Convert all text into small letters.

Why?
Because **Hello** and **hello** should mean the same.

**Example:**
“HELLO WORLD” → “hello world”

---

### **✔ 2. Removing punctuation**

Punctuation marks like `., ! ? ; :` are often not useful.

**Example:**
“I love apples!” → “I love apples”

---

### **✔ 3. Removing numbers (optional)**

Numbers may not be needed for many tasks.

**Example:**
“Item 45 is missing” → “Item is missing”

---

### **✔ 4. Removing extra spaces**

Sometimes text has unwanted spaces or line breaks.

**Example:**
“I    love   Python” → “I love Python”

---

### **✔ 5. Removing stopwords**

Stopwords = common words that do not add much meaning.

Examples:

* the
* is
* am
* are
* on
* in
* of

These words appear too often and do not help in understanding sentiment or topic.

**Example:**
Sentence: “I am happy with the service”
After removing stopwords: “happy service”

---

### **✔ 6. Tokenization**

Breaking a sentence into individual words.

**Example:**
“I love mangoes”
→ ["I", "love", "mangoes"]

This makes analysis easy for the computer.

---

### **✔ 7. Stemming**

Reduce a word to its root form by cutting the end part.

Example:

* playing → play
* danced → danc
* studies → studi

Stemming is rough and sometimes cuts too much.

---

### **✔ 8. Lemmatization**

This is like stemming but more intelligent.
It converts a word to its real root form.

Examples:

* studies → study
* better → good
* dancing → dance

Lemmatization understands grammar.

---

### **✔ 9. Removing URLs, mentions, and hashtags**

Useful for cleaning social media text.

Examples:

* “Follow me @santanu!” → “Follow me”
* “Check this link [https://abc.com”](https://abc.com”) → “Check this link”

---

### **🌟 4. Complete Example (Easy to Understand)**

#### **Original text:**

"   I LOVE this phone!!! It is sooo good 😍😍 Visit [https://shop.com](https://shop.com) NOW!!!   "

#### **After preprocessing:**

* lowercase → “i love this phone!!! it is sooo good 😍😍 visit [https://shop.com](https://shop.com) now!!!”
* remove URLs → “i love this phone!!! it is sooo good 😍😍 visit now!!!”
* remove punctuation → “i love this phone it is sooo good 😍😍 visit now”
* remove extra spaces → “i love this phone it is sooo good visit now”
* remove stopwords → “love phone sooo good visit”
* tokenize → ["love", "phone", "sooo", "good", "visit"]

Now the text is clean and ready for NLP models.

---

### **🌟 5. Why Preprocessing is Important**

Clean text helps:

* better accuracy
* faster training
* less confusion for the model
* better understanding of meaning
* removal of unnecessary noise

If preprocessing is done well, NLP models perform much better.

---

### **🌟 Summary (Very Simple Points)**

* Text preprocessing = cleaning text
* Makes text ready for machine learning
* Common steps: lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
* Clean text = smarter model output
