# **📘 Part 8 — NLP & Sequence Models**

### **Introduction (Very Simple and Friendly Explanation)**

In this part, we enter a world where computers learn to **understand human language** — the way we speak, write, chat, and express ideas. This field is called **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**.

Think of it like teaching a computer to read and understand text just like a person.

Just like a person needs to:

* clean the text before reading,
* understand the meaning of words,
* follow the order of sentences,
* remember what came before,
* focus on important parts,

…a computer also needs similar steps.

This part will slowly guide you through all these ideas in a simple, everyday way.

### **💡 What you will learn in this part**

#### **Lesson 71 — What is NLP?**

A simple introduction: how computers read text, understand sentences, and extract meaning.

#### **Lesson 72 — Text Preprocessing**

How to clean text so a computer can handle it easily — like removing extra symbols, converting to lowercase, etc.

#### **Lesson 73 — Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF**

How to convert words into numbers.
(Think of it like counting how many times each word appears.)

#### **Lesson 74 — Word Embeddings**

A better way to turn words into numbers so the computer understands meaning.
(E.g., “king” and “queen” are related.)

#### **Lesson 75 — RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**

A simple model that learns from sequences — like reading a sentence one word at a time.

#### **Lesson 76 — LSTM Networks**

An improved RNN that can remember important things for longer.
(Helpful for long sentences.)

#### **Lesson 77 — GRU Networks**

A simpler version of LSTM that also remembers things well.

#### **Lesson 78 — Attention Mechanism**

A very simple explanation of how models “pay attention” to important words in a sentence.

#### **Lesson 79 — Transformers (BERT, GPT)**

The models behind modern AI — explained in a clear, beginner-friendly way.

#### **Lesson 80 — NLP Project: Text Classifier Using Transformers**

A small hands-on project where we build an NLP model that can classify text.

### **🌟 Why this part is important**

NLP is used in almost everything today:

* Chatbots
* Google Search
* Email spam filters
* Translation (English ↔ Hindi)
* Sentiment analysis (positive/negative reviews)

By the end of Part 8, you will understand how these systems work in a simple, practical way — without feeling overwhelmed.
