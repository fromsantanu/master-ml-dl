# **Lesson 74: Word Embeddings**

*(Explained in very simple, everyday language)*

---

## **🌟 1. What are Word Embeddings? (Very Simple Meaning)**

Word embeddings are a way to **turn words into numbers** so that a computer can understand them —
**but with meaning included**.

Earlier methods like Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF only counted words.
They did **not** understand meaning.

Word embeddings solve this problem.

### **✔ Word embeddings capture meaning.**

They make words with similar meanings have **similar numeric values**.

Examples:

* “king” and “queen” → numbers close to each other
* “happy” and “joyful” → close to each other
* “apple” and “banana” → close (both fruits)
* “book” and “car” → far apart (not similar)

This is why embeddings are powerful.

---

## **🌟 2. Why do we need embeddings?**

Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF treat words like:

* “good” and “great” → totally different
* “Delhi” and “Mumbai” → totally different
* “king” and “queen” → totally different

But in real life:

* good ≈ great
* Delhi ≈ Mumbai (both cities)
* king ≈ queen (similar roles)

Word embeddings help the computer **understand these relationships**.

---

## **🌟 3. A Simple Analogy: Think of a Map**

Imagine you draw a map and place cities based on closeness:

* Delhi near Gurgaon
* Kolkata near Howrah
* London far from Mumbai

Word embeddings work like this map.

Words with similar meaning are placed near each other in a **multi-dimensional space**
(you can think of it as a smart map inside the computer).

---

## **🌟 4. How Embeddings Work (Simple Explanation)**

Embeddings assign **a list of numbers** (like coordinates) to each word.

For example:

| Word   | Embedding (example)      |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| king   | [0.7, 0.2, 0.4, 0.9]     |
| queen  | [0.69, 0.25, 0.41, 0.92] |
| banana | [0.1, 0.8, 0.9, 0.2]     |
| mango  | [0.12, 0.82, 0.88, 0.25] |

Notice:

* king ≈ queen (similar numbers)
* banana ≈ mango (similar numbers)

The computer sees these similarities and understands relationships.

## **🌟 5. Famous Word Embedding Methods**

You don’t have to know the math, but it’s good to know the names:

### **✔ Word2Vec**

Learns meaning based on surrounding words.
Example: “The king sat on the throne” helps it understand king → throne → royal.

### **✔ GloVe**

Learns meaning by looking at word frequencies across a large text.

### **✔ FastText**

Looks inside words too.
Example: “playing” → play + ing
This helps with spelling or unknown words.

---

## **🌟 6. Powerful Property: Relationships Between Words**

Embeddings can understand relationships like:

**king − man + woman = queen**

This may look like magic, but it’s because embeddings capture meaning in numbers.

Another example:

**Paris − France + India ≈ Delhi**

Why?
Because the relationship “capital of” is learned by the model.

---

## **🌟 7. Simple Real-Life Example**

Imagine you teach a child by giving examples:

* father → man → parent
* mother → woman → parent
* apple → fruit → food

The child begins to group them:

* Parents
* Fruits
* Places
* Countries

Word embeddings help the computer form these groups automatically.

---

## **🌟 8. Why Word Embeddings Are So Important**

They allow NLP models to:

* understand meaning
* find similar words
* identify word relationships
* improve accuracy in NLP tasks like classification, translation, question answering, sentiment analysis

Without embeddings, modern NLP would not be possible.

Transformers (like BERT and GPT) also start with **embeddings**.

---

## **🌟 Summary (Very Simple Points)**

* Word embeddings convert words → numbers **with meaning**
* Similar words have similar numbers
* They act like a “semantic map,” placing related words close together
* Popular methods: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText
* Help in almost all modern NLP tasks
