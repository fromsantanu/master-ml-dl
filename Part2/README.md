## 🌟 **PART 2 — SUPERVISED LEARNING (INTRODUCTION)**

*Lessons 16–30*

Welcome to **Part 2**, where we step into one of the most important areas of machine learning: **Supervised Learning**.

Think of supervised learning like learning with the help of a teacher.

* You show the model **examples**.
* Each example has a **question** (input) and a **correct answer** (label).
* Over time, the model learns the pattern, just like a student learns from solved examples in a textbook.

### 🧒 **A Simple Real-Life Example**

Imagine you run a small fruit shop.

You see different mangoes every day.
You know their **weight**, **color**, and **size**, and you also know their **price**.

After seeing many mangoes:

* If someone gives you a new mango, you can **guess its price** from experience.

This is exactly what supervised learning does.
The model learns from old examples and gives answers for new ones.

### 🎯 **What You Will Learn in This Part**

In this section, we will explore many popular supervised learning methods. Each one is like a different tool in a toolbox. Some tools are simple, some are powerful, and each works best for a particular job.

#### 🟦 **Regression Models** — For predicting numbers

* Linear Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Regression error measurements (MAE, MSE, RMSE)

These models help answer questions like:
**“What will be the price?”**
**“How many units will be sold?”**

---

#### 🟥 **Classification Models** — For predicting categories

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* XGBoost
* SVM
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* Performance measures like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC-AUC and PR Curves

These models help answer questions like:
**“Is this email spam or not?”**
**“Will this patient test positive or negative?”**
**“Is this transaction fraud or genuine?”**

### 🧰 **Why So Many Algorithms?**

Just like:

* you don’t use a hammer to cut vegetables,
* and you don’t use a knife to fix a nail,

Different ML problems need different algorithms.

In **Lesson 30**, we will learn how to **choose the right algorithm** depending on the problem.

### 🧾 **How We Will Learn**

Every lesson will follow a simple pattern:

* Clear explanation
* Real-life example
* When to use the method
* Simple diagrams or intuition
* Small steps, no heavy math

By the end of Part 2, you will be able to confidently pick any supervised learning algorithm and know **what it does**, **why it works**, and **where to use it**.

Whenever you're ready, you can ask for **Lesson 16: Linear Regression**.
