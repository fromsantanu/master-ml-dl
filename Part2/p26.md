# **Lesson 27 — Regression Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE**

*Explained in very simple, everyday language*

---

### 🌟 **Why Do We Need Regression Metrics?**

When a model predicts **numbers** (like house price, rainfall, sales),
we must check **how far the predictions are from the real values**.

Regression metrics help us measure this error.

The three most common ones are:

* **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
* **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
* **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)

Don’t worry — they are simpler than they sound.

## 🧒 **Before We Start: What Is an Error?**

Error = **difference between predicted value and actual value**

Example:

* Actual price = ₹100
* Predicted price = ₹90
* Error = 10

If another prediction is:

* Actual = ₹100
* Prediction = ₹130
* Error = 30

---

# 🟦 **1. MAE — Mean Absolute Error**

### 🌟 Meaning:

👉 **Average of all absolute errors**
(Absolute = remove minus sign)

### 🧒 Simple Example:

Actual prices:
100, 150, 200

Predicted:
110, 140, 180

Errors:
10, 10, 20

MAE = (10 + 10 + 20) / 3 = **13.3**

So, on average, the model is off by ₹13.3.

### 👍 Good Because:

* Easy to understand
* Treats all errors equally

### ⚠️ Limitation:

* Doesn’t punish big mistakes heavily

---

# 🟩 **2. MSE — Mean Squared Error**

### 🌟 Meaning:

👉 **Average of squared errors**

Why square?
Because big mistakes become *very big* after squaring.

Example:

* Error 5 → 25
* Error 20 → 400

This way, the model gets punished more for large errors.

### 🧒 Example:

Errors: 10, 10, 20

Squared errors:
100, 100, 400

MSE = (100 + 100 + 400) / 3 = **200**

### 👍 Good Because:

* Great for punishing big mistakes
* Used commonly in training

### ⚠️ Limitation:

* Harder to interpret because values are large
* Units are “squared” (e.g., rupees²)

---

# 🟪 **3. RMSE — Root Mean Squared Error**

### 🌟 Meaning:

👉 **Square root of MSE**

The root brings the number back to the original scale.

### 🧒 Example using earlier MSE:

MSE = 200
RMSE = √200 ≈ **14.14**

This means:
👉 On average, the model’s prediction is off by about 14.14 units.

### 👍 Good Because:

* Punishes large errors
* Easy to interpret (same units as original data)
* Commonly used in real-world work

### ⚠️ Limitation:

* Still sensitive to extreme errors (outliers)

# 🎯 **When to Use Which? (Easy Guide)**

| Metric   | When to Use                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **MAE**  | When you want a simple, clear error measure |
| **MSE**  | When large errors must be punished heavily  |
| **RMSE** | Most popular; balanced between MAE and MSE  |

# 🧱 **Real-Life Example: Predicting House Price**

Actual price = ₹50,00,000
Predictions:

* Model A → ₹48,00,000
* Model B → ₹40,00,000

Errors:

* Model A = 2,00,000
* Model B = 10,00,000

MAE would treat them equally in average form,
but MSE/RMSE would punish Model B much more strongly
because its error is very large.

This helps us choose better models.

---

# 🧱 **Real-Life Example: Predicting Student Marks**

Actual marks = 80
Predictions:

* Model A = 78 (error = 2)

* Model B = 60 (error = 20)

* MAE → both errors count as 2 and 20

* MSE → 2² = 4, 20² = 400 → big difference

* RMSE → √(404/2) → clear that Model B is much worse

---

# 🏁 **Summary (Very Simple)**

* **MAE** → average of errors, easy to understand
* **MSE** → squares errors, punishes large mistakes
* **RMSE** → square root of MSE, most commonly used

Whenever you predict numbers (regression),
these three metrics help you understand how “off” the model is.
