# **Lesson 29 — ROC–AUC & PR Curves**

*Explained in very simple, everyday language*

---

### 🌟 **Why Do We Need ROC and PR Curves?**

When a model predicts **categories** (YES/NO),
it usually gives a **probability**, like:

* 0.90 → 90% chance of “YES”
* 0.30 → 30% chance of “YES”

But now we must decide:
**At what cut-off do we say YES?**
Is it 0.5? 0.6? 0.7?

Different cut-offs give different results.

👉 **ROC and PR curves help us understand how good the model is across ALL possible cut-offs**, not just one.

This gives a complete picture of performance.

---

## **Part 1 — ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic)**

### 🌟 **What does ROC tell us?**

ROC curve shows how well the model separates:

* **Positive class** (YES)
* **Negative class** (NO)

It does this by checking:

* **True Positive Rate** (Recall)
* **False Positive Rate** (False alarms)

For many thresholds (0.1, 0.2, 0.3…).

---

### 🧒 **Simple Idea**

Imagine you are a security guard checking visitors.

If you tighten checking (higher threshold):

* You will catch more intruders (high recall)
* But you may also stop more innocent people (high false positives)

If you loosen checking (lower threshold):

* You may let intruders go (low recall)
* But you disturb fewer innocents (low false positives)

ROC curve checks many such combinations
and draws a graph.

## 📈 **What ROC Curve Looks Like**

```
TPR (Recall)  |
1.0           |         ● Best models stay here
              |       /
0.5           |     /
              |   /
0.0           |__/________________
                  0.0   FPR    1.0
```

* **Left-top corner** = excellent model
* **Diagonal line** = useless model (random guessing)
* **Below diagonal** = worse than random

---

## 🎯 **AUC (Area Under Curve)**

AUC is the **score** of the ROC curve.
Higher AUC = better model.

* **AUC 0.9–1.0** → Excellent
* **AUC 0.8–0.9** → Very good
* **AUC 0.7–0.8** → Good
* **AUC 0.6–0.7** → Weak
* **AUC < 0.6** → Poor

👉 AUC shows how well the model can separate the two classes.

---

## ⏳ **When ROC-AUC Works Best**

* When **classes are balanced**
  (almost equal number of YES and NO)

Example:
Spam vs Not spam (balanced dataset).

---

# **Part 2 — PR Curve (Precision–Recall Curve)**

### 🌟 Why PR Curve?

PR curve focuses on:

* **Precision** → among predicted YES, how many were correct
* **Recall** → out of all actual YES, how many were found

PR curve is mainly used when the positive class is **rare**.

---

### 🧒 **Simple Example**

Imagine:

* 1 out of 100 transactions is fraud
  → Fraud is **rare**

If a model predicts “NO fraud” for all 100:

* Accuracy = 99%
* But it missed the 1 real fraud → useless!

Precision and Recall give a **clearer picture** on such problems.

---

## 📈 **What PR Curve Looks Like**

```
Precision  |
1.0        | ●●●
0.5        |   ●
0.0        |_____________
             0.0   Recall 1.0
```

### 🌟 **AUC-PR (Area under PR curve)**

Tells you how well the model performs **when positives are rare**.

---

## 🎯 **When to Use PR Curve?**

Use PR curve when:

* Data is **imbalanced**
* Positive class is **rare**

Examples:

* Fraud detection
* Cancer detection
* Rare disease detection
* Fault detection in machines

PR curve gives much more honest results than ROC in these cases.

# 🌱 **ROC vs PR Curve (Super Simple Comparison)**

| Situation                       | Best Curve  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Classes balanced                | **ROC-AUC** |
| Positive class rare             | **PR-AUC**  |
| Want overall separation ability | **ROC-AUC** |
| Want performance on positives   | **PR-AUC**  |

---

# 🧠 **Tiny Example for Clarity**

Imagine 1000 emails:

* 950 normal
* 50 spam

A model says all 1000 are normal:

* Accuracy = 95%
  But it missed all spam emails → terrible model.

ROC may still look okay,
but PR curve will be **very bad**,
showing the true performance.

---

# 🏁 **Summary (Very Simple)**

### **ROC-AUC**

* Measures how well the model separates YES vs NO
* Good when classes are balanced
* AUC close to 1 = excellent model

### **PR Curve**

* Measures precision vs recall
* Best for rare events
* Shows how well the model identifies important cases

Both curves help us understand model performance much better than just accuracy.
