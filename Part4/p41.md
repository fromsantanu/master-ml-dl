# **Lesson 41: Feature Engineering — Simple Tricks**

### *Making your data more meaningful for the model*

Feature Engineering simply means **creating better columns** from the existing data so that the machine learning model understands the problem more clearly.

Think of it like cooking:
Even if you have simple vegetables, the way you cut, mix, or prepare them can completely change the taste.
Similarly, in ML, how you prepare your data can completely change the model’s accuracy.

## **🟦 1. Why do we need Feature Engineering?**

Raw data is often not very helpful.
Models cannot easily understand things like dates, long text, or messy values.

So we **create new useful features** from old ones.

A simple example:
You have a “Date of Birth” column.
The model does not understand it.
But if you convert it to **Age**, the model suddenly understands it much better.

## **🟦 2. Simple Tricks for Feature Engineering**

Here are some very easy but powerful tricks you can use.

---

### **✔ Trick 1: Splitting Date into Parts**

If you have a date (like 2021-08-12), you can split it into:

* Year
* Month
* Day
* Day of week (Monday, Tuesday…)

**Example:**
Instead of just “12-08-2021,”
you create:

* `year = 2021`
* `month = 8`
* `day = 12`
* `weekday = Thursday`

Why useful?
Because sales may be higher in December, or traffic may be higher on Monday mornings.

---

### **✔ Trick 2: Creating Age from Date of Birth**

If you have Date of Birth: 1990
and current year is 2025,
you create:

```
age = 2025 - 1990 = 35
```

This is much easier for a model to understand.

---

### **✔ Trick 3: Extracting Length of Text**

If you have a text column like a review:

“Food was excellent and service was slow.”

You can create:

* length of text = number of characters
* number of words
* does it contain positive or negative words?

These help in sentiment analysis.

---

### **✔ Trick 4: Binning / Grouping Values**

Sometimes converting continuous numbers to groups helps.

Example:
Age can be grouped as:

* 0–12 → child
* 13–19 → teenager
* 20–40 → adult
* 40+ → senior

Why?
Models may find patterns easier in groups.

---

### **✔ Trick 5: Creating Ratios**

Ratios are very powerful in ML.

If you have:

* total_marks
* marks_in_math

You can create:

```
math_ratio = marks_in_math / total_marks
```

It shows how strong the student is in math relative to total.

---

### **✔ Trick 6: One-Hot Encoding for Categories**

If you have categories like
`red`, `blue`, `green`

You convert them into separate columns:

```
is_red
is_blue
is_green
```

Each column has either 1 or 0.

Example:
A row with “blue” becomes:

```
red = 0
blue = 1
green = 0
```

This makes categories understandable to ML.

---

### **✔ Trick 7: Combining Features**

Sometimes combining two features creates a meaningful one.

Example:
If you have:

* height
* weight

You can create:

```
BMI = weight / (height * height)
```

BMI is much more meaningful for health predictions than height or weight alone.

---

## **🟦 3. Simple Real-Life Example**

Suppose you are predicting house prices.
You have columns:

* built_year
* area in sq ft
* number of rooms
* location

Feature engineering adds:

* age_of_house = current_year – built_year
* price_per_sqft = price / area
* is_corner_plot = yes/no
* distance_to_main_road

These new features make the model much smarter.

---

## **🟦 4. Summary**

Feature Engineering is like preparing ingredients before cooking —
the better the preparation, the better the final result.

You learned simple tricks like:

* Splitting dates
* Creating age
* Counting text length
* Grouping values
* Making ratios
* Combining features
* One-hot encoding

These small steps can dramatically improve model performance.
