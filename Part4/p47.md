# **Lesson 47: Regularization (L1, L2)**

### *A simple way to control overfitting*

Regularization is a technique used to **stop a model from overfitting**.

Remember from the last lesson:
Overfitting means the model becomes *too smart in a bad way* — it memorizes every tiny detail in the training data, including mistakes (noise).
Regularization works like a **gentle brake** that prevents the model from getting overly complicated.

Think of it like holding a kite string.
Without control, the kite flies wildly.
Regularization keeps the model stable and balanced.

---

## **🟦 1. Why do we need Regularization?**

Because many models tend to become unnecessarily complex.
They try to fit every point perfectly, even if the data has noise or errors.

Regularization helps by:

* reducing the model’s complexity
* preventing memorization
* improving performance on new data

It makes the model focus on **important features** and ignore unimportant ones.

---

## **🟦 2. How Regularization Works (Simple Explanation)**

Regularization adds a small **penalty** whenever the model becomes too complex.

This penalty forces the model to:

* shrink large coefficients
* reduce unnecessary weight
* prefer simpler patterns

Think of it like telling a student:
“Don’t write 10 pages for a 2-mark question. Keep it short.”

---

## **🟦 3. Two Types of Regularization: L1 and L2**

We will explain both in very simple everyday language.

---

## **✔ L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)**

### *Pushes values to be small but not zero*

L2 regularization tries to make all feature weights **small and smooth**.

It doesn’t remove features;
it simply reduces their effect.

### **Real-Life Example**

If you have 10 spices at home,
L2 says:

> “Use all spices, but use small amounts.”

So all spices remain in the dish, but none dominate the taste.

### **Effect on Model**

* reduces overfitting
* keeps all features
* makes the model stable

---

## **✔ L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)**

### *Pushes some values to exactly zero*

L1 regularization is stronger.
It forces some feature weights to become **zero**.

This means the feature is completely removed from the model.

### **Real-Life Example**

This is like cleaning your room:

* You keep important items
* You throw away useless items
  Your room becomes clean and simpler.

L1 does the same for ML models —
it removes unnecessary columns.

### **Effect on Model**

* reduces overfitting
* removes unimportant features
* makes the model simple
* performs automatic **feature selection**

## **🟦 4. L1 vs L2 — Simple Comparison**

| Feature                         | L1 (Lasso)           | L2 (Ridge)           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Effect on weights               | Some become **zero** | All become **small** |
| Removes useless features?       | ✔ Yes                | ❌ No                 |
| Good for high-dimensional data? | ✔ Very good          | ✔ Good               |
| Model simplicity                | High                 | Medium               |
| Helps when features are many?   | ✔ Best               | Good                 |

## **🟦 5. When to use which?**

### **Use L1 (Lasso) when:**

* you want feature selection
* many features are not useful
* data has too many columns

### **Use L2 (Ridge) when:**

* you want all features but smaller weights
* model is unstable
* you want smooth performance

### **Use both together (Elastic Net) when:**

* you want a balance
* your data is messy and complex

---

## **🟦 6. Simple Example**

Suppose you have the following features to predict house rent:

* area
* number of rooms
* location
* age of building
* wall color
* number of window grills
* last paint brand

Some of these are clearly useless.

### With L2:

* wall color weight becomes small
* paint brand weight becomes smaller
* but they are still kept

### With L1:

* wall color becomes **0**
* paint brand becomes **0**
* they get removed completely

The model becomes cleaner and performs better.

---

## **🟦 7. Summary**

Regularization is a simple but powerful tool to control overfitting.

* **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**
  → makes weights small
  → keeps all features

* **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**
  → makes some weights zero
  → removes unimportant features
  → performs feature selection

Think of L2 as “using every ingredient lightly”
and L1 as “throwing away ingredients you don’t need.”
