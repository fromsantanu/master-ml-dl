# **Lesson 46: Overfitting & Underfitting**

### *When the model learns too much or too little*

Overfitting and underfitting are two of the most common problems in machine learning.

A simple way to remember:

* **Underfitting → model is too dumb** (learns too little)
* **Overfitting → model is too smart in a bad way** (memorizes too much)

Let’s understand this using very simple examples.

## **🟦 1. What is Underfitting?**

Underfitting happens when the model **does not learn enough patterns** from the data.

It is like:

* A student who studies only the first chapter and then appears for the whole exam.
  He cannot answer even simple questions because he did not learn enough.

### **Signs of Underfitting**

* Low accuracy on training data
* Low accuracy on test data
* Model looks too simple

### **Causes**

* Model is too simple (example: using a straight line for a curved pattern)
* Not enough training
* Important features missing
* Wrong algorithm

---

## **🟦 2. What is Overfitting?**

Overfitting happens when the model **learns too many details**, including noise, mistakes, and random patterns.

It is like:

* A student who memorizes the entire textbook word-for-word,
  but cannot explain anything in his own words.

He performs well on questions he memorized,
but fails on new questions.

### **Signs of Overfitting**

* Very high accuracy on training data
* Poor accuracy on test data
* Model is too complex

### **Causes**

* Too many features
* Too complex model
* Not enough data
* No regularization
* Model trained for too long

## **🟦 3. Simple Real-Life Example**

Imagine trying to draw a curve through a set of points.

### **Underfitting:**

You draw a straight line even though the pattern is curved.
Very simple → misses the true shape.

### **Overfitting:**

You draw a line that touches every single point by making too many twists and turns.
It looks perfect on the known points,
but completely fails on new points.

### **Good Fit:**

You draw a smooth curve that follows the main shape but ignores small random bumps.

## **🟦 4. How to Fix Underfitting**

✔ Use a more complex model
✔ Add more useful features
✔ Reduce regularization
✔ Train longer
✔ Try a different algorithm

Like studying a bit more or using better books to understand the topic.

---

## **🟦 5. How to Fix Overfitting**

✔ Simplify the model (reduce depth, reduce features)
✔ Add regularization (L1, L2)
✔ Use more training data
✔ Use dropout (in neural networks)
✔ Use cross-validation
✔ Early stopping (stop training before the model memorizes noise)

Like telling a student:
“Don’t memorize line-by-line.
Understand the main ideas.”

## **🟦 6. Visual Summary**

* **Underfitting → Too simple → Bad on train + test**
* **Perfect Fit → Just right → Good on train + test**
* **Overfitting → Too complex → Good on train, bad on test**

## **🟦 7. Practical Example**

### Predicting house prices:

#### Underfitting:

Model only uses “area” to predict price.
But price depends on rooms, location, age, etc.
Too simple → bad predictions.

#### Overfitting:

Model memorizes that
“House with 1020 sq ft and blue paint = ₹52,00,000”
This detail is useless and harms prediction.

---

## **🟦 8. Summary**

* Underfitting = model learns **too little**
* Overfitting = model learns **too much, including noise**
* Good model = learns the right amount

We fix overfitting by simplifying the model and using regularization.
We fix underfitting by making the model more powerful or giving it better features.
