# ⭐ **Lesson 3: What is Data? — Rows, Columns, Features, Labels**

### *Explained in very simple, everyday language*

Machine Learning runs on **data**, the same way a car runs on fuel.
If the data is good, the model learns well.
If the data is bad, the model becomes confused.

So first, we must understand *what data really is* in very simple terms.

---

# 🍽️ **1. What is data? (Simple meaning)**

Data is just **information collected in a structured way**, usually in the form of a table.

Imagine your school attendance register:

* Each row = details of one student
* Each column = one type of information (name, class, roll number, marks)

This is exactly how ML sees data.

---

# 📊 **2. Data looks like a table**

Most ML data looks like a simple Excel sheet:

| Name  | Age | City   | Salary |
| ----- | --- | ------ | ------ |
| Ravi  | 25  | Delhi  | 30,000 |
| Maria | 30  | Mumbai | 45,000 |

This table-like structure is the backbone of most ML tasks.

---

# 🧱 **3. What are rows? (Individual examples)**

A **row** is one complete example or one record.

In the table above:

* Ravi → one row
* Maria → another row

### ✨ Real-life example

If you want to predict house prices:

| Size (sq ft) | Location | Price    |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- |
| 800          | City A   | 40 lakhs |
| 1200         | City B   | 55 lakhs |

Each row = one house.
The ML model studies all houses row by row.

---

# 🧱 **4. What are columns? (Attributes or properties)**

A **column** is one type of information about each row.

In the house example:

* Size
* Location
* Price

Each column tells us **one property** of the house.

---

# 🎯 **5. What are features? (Inputs given to the model)**

Features are just a fancy word for **input columns**.

They are the details we use to predict something.

In the house example:

**Features = Size, Location**
(because they help us predict the price)

Another example: predicting if a student will pass or fail.

Features may include:

* Number of hours studied
* Attendance
* Previous marks

These are all *inputs* to the ML model.

### ✔ Simple way to remember

**Features = the clues the computer uses to make a prediction.**

---

# 🎯 **6. What is a label? (The answer we want the model to learn)**

The **label** is the output column we want to predict.

In the house example:

* We want to predict **Price**
  → So price is the **label**

In a spam detection example:

| Email Text        | Spam/Not Spam |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| "Win a prize!"    | Spam          |
| "Meeting at 5 PM" | Not Spam      |

Here, the label is: **Spam/Not Spam**

### ✔ Simple way to remember

**Label = the answer the model should learn.**

---

# 🎒 **7. Simple analogy (like exam preparation)**

Imagine preparing for an exam:

* Chapters → Features (inputs)
* Practice questions → Rows
* Correct answer → Label
* All chapters + all answers → Data

Your brain is learning the patterns.
Machine Learning does the same thing.

---

# 🧠 **8. Summary of key terms**

| Word         | Easy Meaning               | Simple Example                |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Data**     | Information in a table     | School attendance sheet       |
| **Rows**     | One complete example       | One student                   |
| **Columns**  | Type of information        | Age, City, Marks              |
| **Features** | Inputs used for prediction | “Hours studied”, “Attendance” |
| **Label**    | Output we want to predict  | “Pass/Fail”                   |

---

# 🎯 Final takeaway

Machine Learning learns from data organized like a simple table:

* **Rows = examples**
* **Columns = information**
* **Features = inputs**
* **Label = answer to predict**

Once you understand this, everything else in ML becomes easier.
