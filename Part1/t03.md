# **Lesson 3 — What is Data? (Rows, Columns, Features, Labels)**

Machine Learning systems operate on **structured information**, commonly represented as **tabular data**. Understanding the structure of this data is fundamental because every ML model expects inputs in a well-defined format.

This lesson clarifies the basic units of data used in ML:

* Rows (observations)
* Columns (variables)
* Features (input variables)
* Labels (target variables)

# **1. Data as a Matrix**

Most ML datasets can be represented as a matrix:

[
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \dots & x_{1d} \
x_{21} & x_{22} & \dots & x_{2d} \
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \
x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \dots & x_{nd}
\end{bmatrix}
]

Where:

* ( n ) = number of samples (rows)
* ( d ) = number of features (columns)

Each sample ( X_i \in \mathbb{R}^d ) is a row vector.

---

# **2. Rows = Observations (Samples)**

A **row** represents one complete data point (one instance or example).

Example:

| Age | Income | City   |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 25  | 40,000 | Delhi  |
| 32  | 55,000 | Mumbai |

Each row corresponds to one entity (a person, a product, a measurement).

If there are ( n ) rows, the dataset has ( n ) observations:

[
X = {X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n}
]

---

# **3. Columns = Variables (Attributes)**

A **column** represents one type of information.

Example columns:

* Age
* Salary
* Temperature
* City
* Blood Pressure

If there are ( d ) columns, the dataset has ( d ) variables (dimension = ( d )).

---

# **4. Features = Input Variables**

A **feature** is a column used as an **input** for the model.

Suppose we want to predict house prices.
Dataset:

| Size (sqft) | Bedrooms | Location | Price |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1200        | 2        | A        | 55    |
| 1500        | 3        | B        | 75    |

Inputs (features):

[
X = [\text{Size}, \text{Bedrooms}, \text{Location}]
]

Mathematically, for each sample:

[
X_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ..., x_{id})
]

Not all columns have to be features; we select features during preprocessing.

---

# **5. Labels = Target Variable (Only in Supervised Learning)**

A **label** (also called target, output, or response) is the value we want the model to predict.

In supervised learning, each example has a label (Y_i).

### Examples

1. **Regression**

   * Predicting price:
     [
     Y = \text{Price}
     ]

2. **Classification**

   * Spam vs Not-spam:
     [
     Y \in {0, 1}
     ]

3. **Medical Diagnosis**

   * Disease presence (1) or absence (0)

Dataset structure in supervised learning:

[
\mathcal{D} = {(X_i, Y_i)}_{i=1}^n
]

---

# **6. Complete Numerical Example**

Dataset:

| (x_1) (Hours) | (x_2) (Practice Tests) | (Y) (Score) |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| 2             | 1                      | 55          |
| 4             | 2                      | 65          |
| 6             | 3                      | 78          |

Then:

[
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 \
4 & 2 \
6 & 3
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
Y =
\begin{bmatrix}
55 \
65 \
78
\end{bmatrix}
]

Here:

* (X) is the **feature matrix**
* (Y) is the **label vector**
* Each row of (X) is one training example
* Each column of (X) is one feature

# **7. Summary Table**

| Concept     | Meaning         | Mathematical Form | Example           |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Row**     | One observation | (X_i)             | One person’s data |
| **Column**  | One variable    | (x_{ij})          | Age, Salary       |
| **Feature** | Input to model  | (X) or (X_i)      | Age, Bedrooms     |
| **Label**   | Target output   | (Y_i)             | Price, Score      |

---

# **Key Takeaways**

* Data in ML is typically represented as a matrix (X).
* **Rows** = samples, **columns** = variables.
* **Features** are input variables; **labels** are outputs to be predicted.
* Understanding this structure is fundamental to all ML algorithms.
