# **Lesson 4 — Types of Data: Numerical, Categorical, Text, Image**

Machine learning algorithms operate on different kinds of data. Understanding the data type is essential because each type requires different preprocessing, encoding, and modeling methods.

This lesson describes the four major data types encountered in ML:

1. **Numerical Data**
2. **Categorical Data**
3. **Text Data**
4. **Image Data**

# **1. Numerical Data**

Numerical data consists of values that are **quantitative** and can be measured on a numeric scale.

There are two subtypes:

## **a) Continuous Numerical Data**

Values on a continuous range.

Examples:

* Temperature: ( 23.5^\circ C )
* Height: ( 172 \text{ cm} )
* House price: ( 5.8 \text{ lakhs} )

Mathematically:

* Continuous data ( x \in \mathbb{R} )

## **b) Discrete Numerical Data**

Values are counts or integers.

Examples:

* Number of rooms: ( 1,2,3,4 )
* Number of clicks
* Number of visits

Mathematically:

* Discrete data ( x \in \mathbb{Z} )

---

# **2. Categorical Data**

Categorical data consists of **labels**, **groups**, or **classes** rather than numeric values.

There are two main types:

## **a) Nominal Categorical Data**

No inherent order between categories.

Examples:

* City: {Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata}
* Gender: {Male, Female}
* Colour: {Red, Blue, Green}

Model cannot assume:
[
\text{Delhi} < \text{Mumbai} < \text{Kolkata}
]

## **b) Ordinal Categorical Data**

Categories have a meaningful order.

Examples:

* Size: {Small < Medium < Large}
* Rating: {Bad < Neutral < Good}
* Education level: {High School < Graduate < Postgraduate}

Mathematically, ordinal variables allow ordering but not arithmetic.

### **Why categorical data matters**

ML models require categorical values to be encoded to numerical form (e.g., One-hot, Label encoding).

---

# **3. Text Data**

Text data consists of **strings, sentences, or documents**. It is unstructured and needs specialized preprocessing.

Examples:

* User reviews
* Tweets and social media posts
* Medical notes
* Chat logs
* News articles

## **Numerical Representations**

Text is usually transformed into:

* **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** vectors
* **TF-IDF vectors**
* **Word embeddings** like Word2Vec, GloVe
* **Contextual embeddings** like BERT, GPT

A document (d) is mapped to a numeric vector:

[
d \rightarrow \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^k
]

This allows ML models to process textual patterns.

---

# **4. Image Data**

Images are represented as arrays (matrices) of pixel intensity values.

## **Grayscale Image**

[
I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W}
]
Each cell holds a pixel value, usually 0–255.

## **RGB Image**

[
I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}
]

Where:

* 3 channels correspond to Red, Green, Blue
* Each pixel represented as ((R, G, B))

Example:
A 224×224 RGB image contains:
[
224 \times 224 \times 3 = 150{,}528 \text{ pixel values}
]

### **Why image data requires special models**

Neural networks designed for images (e.g., CNNs, Vision Transformers) exploit spatial structure.

# **5. Summary Comparison**

| Data Type       | Description                                  | Examples                   | Notes                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Numerical**   | Quantitative values (continuous or discrete) | Age, income, temperature   | Models handle directly         |
| **Categorical** | Labels or categories                         | City, gender, colour       | Requires encoding              |
| **Text**        | Natural language strings                     | Tweets, reviews, documents | Requires NLP preprocessing     |
| **Image**       | Pixel arrays                                 | Photos, X-rays             | Requires CNNs or vision models |

# **6. Why Data Type Matters in ML**

Different data types require different steps:

| Type        | Preprocessing            | Typical Models          |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Numerical   | Scaling, normalization   | Regression, trees       |
| Categorical | One-hot, embeddings      | Classification, trees   |
| Text        | Tokenization, embeddings | NLP models (LSTM, BERT) |
| Image       | Pixel normalization      | CNNs, ViTs              |

Understanding the data type helps select the right:

* preprocessing method
* feature engineering approach
* ML algorithm

---

# **Key Takeaways**

* **Numerical data** can be used directly after scaling.
* **Categorical data** must be encoded before modeling.
* **Text data** requires converting words into numeric vectors.
* **Image data** is represented as 2D/3D arrays of pixels.

Correctly identifying data types is the foundation for designing the ML pipeline.
