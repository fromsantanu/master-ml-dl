# ⭐ **Lesson 8: Data Cleaning — Missing Values, Duplicates**

### *Explained in very simple, everyday language*

Before we train a Machine Learning model, we must make sure the data is **clean and usable**.
Think of this like cleaning your study table before starting homework.
If the table is messy, you cannot focus.
If the data is messy, the ML model cannot learn properly.

Let's understand data cleaning in very simple terms.

---

# 🧼 **1. What is Data Cleaning? (Simple meaning)**

Data cleaning means **fixing problems in the data** so the ML model learns correctly.

Some common problems:

* Missing values
* Duplicate rows
* Wrong data
* Inconsistent formatting

In this lesson, we will focus on the two most common ones:
👉 missing values
👉 duplicate values

---

# 🕳️ **2. Missing Values (What are they?)**

A missing value means **some information is not recorded**.

### ✔ Examples:

* A student’s age is blank
* A patient’s blood pressure report is missing
* A survey question is left unanswered
* A financial record has no salary value

It looks like:

| Name  | Age | City   |
| ----- | --- | ------ |
| Ravi  | 25  | Delhi  |
| Maria |     | Mumbai |
| John  | 30  |        |

Here, Maria’s age is missing.
John’s city is missing.

---

# 🤔 **3. Why are missing values a problem?**

Because ML models cannot understand blanks.
Blanks confuse the model and lead to poor predictions.

Imagine teaching a child:

“Ravi is __ years old.”
“Maria lives in __.”

The child will also get confused.

---

# 🔧 **4. How do we handle missing values? (Simple methods)**

### **A. Delete rows with missing values**

Useful when:

* only a few rows are missing
* the dataset is large

### **B. Fill missing values with a simple number**

Called **imputation** (don’t worry about the name).

Examples:

* Fill missing age with **average age**
* Fill missing income with **median income**
* Fill missing category with **most common category (mode)**

### **C. Fill with a special label**

Example:
Unknown city → "Not Provided"

This helps keep all rows without throwing away data.

---

# 🧍‍♂️ **5. Example of fixing missing values**

Before cleaning:

| Name  | Age | City   |
| ----- | --- | ------ |
| Ravi  | 25  | Delhi  |
| Maria |     | Mumbai |
| John  | 30  |        |

After cleaning:

| Name  | Age              | City        |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Ravi  | 25               | Delhi       |
| Maria | **27 (avg age)** | Mumbai      |
| John  | 30               | **Unknown** |

Now the data is neat and ready for ML.

---

# 🔁 **6. Duplicates (What are they?)**

Duplicates are **repeated rows** in the dataset.

### ✔ Example:

| Name  | Age | City   |
| ----- | --- | ------ |
| Ravi  | 25  | Delhi  |
| Ravi  | 25  | Delhi  |
| Maria | 30  | Mumbai |

The first two rows are exactly the same.

---

# ⚠️ **7. Why are duplicates a problem?**

Because they:

* Mislead the model
* Create imbalance
* Make some patterns look stronger than they are

### ✔ Example

If one patient’s data is repeated multiple times,
the model will think that case is very common and overfocus on it.

---

# 🧽 **8. How to handle duplicates?**

Very simple:

👉 **Remove duplicate rows**

Most tools (Pandas, Excel, SQL) have a button or function for this.

In Pandas: `drop_duplicates()`
In Excel: "Remove Duplicates" button

After removal, each row appears only once.

---

# 🧹 **9. Real-life example**

Imagine you are counting how many students came to school today.

If you accidentally count Ravi twice,
your total count will be wrong.

ML works the same way.
Duplicates lead to **fake patterns**.

---

# 🌟 **Final takeaway**

Data cleaning is a crucial step before using ML.
Two major cleaning tasks are:

### **1. Handling missing values**

* Delete
* Fill with mean/median/mode
* Mark as “Unknown”

### **2. Removing duplicates**

* Delete repeated rows
* Keep only the unique ones

Clean data → better learning → better predictions.
