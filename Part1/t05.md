# **Lesson 5 — Basic Statistics for Machine Learning**

Statistical concepts form the foundation of Machine Learning.
Before applying any ML algorithm, we must understand the distribution, central tendency, spread, and relationships in the data.

This lesson covers the essential statistical quantities used throughout ML:

1. Measures of Central Tendency
2. Measures of Spread
3. Outliers
4. Correlation
5. Basic Distribution Shapes

# **1. Measures of Central Tendency**

These describe the “center” of the data.

## **a) Mean (Arithmetic Average)**

For values ( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n ):

[
\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i
]

### **Example**

[
x = {10, 12, 14}
]
[
\mu = \frac{10 + 12 + 14}{3} = 12
]

---

## **b) Median (Middle value)**

For sorted data (x_{(1)} \le x_{(2)} \le \dots \le x_{(n)}):

* If ( n ) is odd:
  [
  \text{median} = x_{(\frac{n+1}{2})}
  ]
* If ( n ) is even:
  [
  \text{median} = \frac{x_{(\frac{n}{2})} + x_{(\frac{n}{2}+1)}}{2}
  ]

### **Why median matters**

Median is robust to outliers.

---

## **c) Mode (Most frequent value)**

[
\text{mode}(x) = \text{argmax}_v ; \text{count}(x=v)
]

Useful for categorical data (e.g., most common city).

---

# **2. Measures of Spread (Variance, Standard Deviation, Range)**

Spread measures show how far values deviate from the center.

## **a) Variance**

[
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2
]

Higher variance = more dispersed data.

### **Example**

[
x = {10, 12, 14}, ; \mu=12
]
[
\sigma^2 = \frac{(10-12)^2 + (12-12)^2 + (14-12)^2}{3} = \frac{4 + 0 + 4}{3} = 2.67
]

---

## **b) Standard Deviation (SD)**

[
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
]

Represents typical deviation from the mean.

---

## **c) Range**

[
\text{range} = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}
]

Quick estimate of data spread; sensitive to outliers.

---

# **3. Quantiles and Interquartile Range (IQR)**

## **Quantiles**

The (q^\text{th}) quantile is the value below which (q%) of data lie.

Important quantiles:

* 25th percentile → Q1
* 50th percentile → median
* 75th percentile → Q3

## **Interquartile Range**

[
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
]

Measures middle 50% spread; robust to outliers.

---

# **4. Detecting Outliers**

Outliers are extreme observations that deviate significantly.

Using IQR rule:

[
\text{Lower Fence} = Q1 - 1.5,\text{IQR}
]
[
\text{Upper Fence} = Q3 + 1.5,\text{IQR}
]

Values outside this range are considered outliers.

### **Example**

If Q1 = 20, Q3 = 30:

[
\text{IQR} = 10
]
[
\text{Lower Fence} = 20 - 1.5(10) = 5
]
[
\text{Upper Fence} = 30 + 1.5(10) = 45
]

Any value < 5 or > 45 is an outlier.

Outliers greatly impact ML models such as linear regression.

---

# **5. Correlation**

Correlation measures the **linear relationship** between two numerical variables.

Given variables (X) and (Y):

[
\rho = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
]

Where covariance:

[
\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_X)(Y_i - \mu_Y)
]

### **Correlation range**

* ( \rho = 1 ) → perfect positive linear relation
* ( \rho = -1 ) → perfect negative linear relation
* ( \rho = 0 ) → no linear relation

Correlation helps in feature selection.

---

# **6. Basic Distribution Shapes**

## **a) Normal Distribution**

Density:

[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
]

Symmetric, bell-shaped.
Many ML algorithms assume near-normality in input data.

---

## **b) Skewed Distribution**

* **Right skew** → tail on right (income data)
* **Left skew** → tail on left

Skewness affects normalization and model choice.

---

## **c) Multimodal Distribution**

Multiple peaks → indicates presence of subgroups (clusters).

Useful in clustering and anomaly detection.
