# **Lesson 11 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

*Statistical and Visual Foundations*

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the systematic process of **understanding the structure, distribution, and relationships** within a dataset before modeling.

EDA helps detect patterns, anomalies, errors, and hypotheses about the underlying process that generated the data.

This lesson covers:

1. Goals of EDA
2. Univariate analysis
3. Bivariate and multivariate analysis
4. Correlation analysis
5. Distribution analysis
6. Outlier detection
7. Visual tools for EDA
8. EDA workflow

# **1. Goals of EDA**

The objective is to understand:

* Data quality (missing values, duplicates)
* Distribution of each feature
* Relationships between features
* Presence of outliers or noise
* Class imbalance
* Feature importance hints
* Suitability of algorithms (linear vs nonlinear structure)

EDA answers the question:

[
\text{"What does the data look like?"}
]

---

# **2. Univariate Analysis (One Feature at a Time)**

Univariate analysis focuses on the distribution and summary statistics of each individual feature.

Given a feature (X), compute:

* Mean: (\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i)
* Median: (m = x_{(\frac{n+1}{2})})
* Variance: (\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum (x_i-\mu)^2)
* Standard deviation: (\sigma)
* Skewness:
  [
  \text{Skew}(X) = \frac{1}{n} \sum \left(\frac{X_i - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^3
  ]
* Kurtosis (tail heaviness)

### Numerical Features

Visual tools:

* Histogram
* Boxplot
* Density curve (Kernel Density Estimation)

### Categorical Features

Tools:

* Bar chart
* Frequency table

---

# **3. Bivariate Analysis (Feature vs Feature)**

Assesses how two variables relate.

### **Numerical vs Numerical**

Use:

* Scatter plot
* Correlation
* Covariance
* Regression line

Covariance:
[
\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum (X_i-\mu_X)(Y_i-\mu_Y)
]

### **Numerical vs Categorical**

Use:

* Boxplots grouped by category
* Grouped histograms
* Summary statistics per category

### **Categorical vs Categorical**

Use:

* Cross-tabulation
* Heatmaps
* Chi-square test for association

---

# **4. Multivariate Analysis (More than 2 Features)**

Used to identify broader structural patterns across multiple variables.

Techniques:

* Pair plot (scatterplot matrix)
* Correlation heatmap
* PCA scatterplots
* Parallel coordinates

Helps reveal clusters, non-linear relationships, feature redundancy.

---

# **5. Correlation Analysis**

Correlation matrix:

[
R_{ij} = \rho(X_i, X_j)
]

Where:
[
\rho = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
]

Heatmaps visually indicate strength and direction of relationships.

### Why Important?

* Highly correlated features → multicollinearity
* Suggests dimensionality reduction (PCA)
* Helps select appropriate models

---

# **6. Distribution Analysis**

Many ML algorithms assume that data follows certain distributions (e.g., Gaussian).

Tools:

* Histogram
* KDE plot
* QQ-plot
* Shapiro-Wilk test (normality)

For variable (X), Gaussian PDF:

[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-(x - \mu)^2 / (2\sigma^2)}
]

Check for:

* Skewed distribution
* Bimodal or multimodal distribution
* Heavy tails

---

# **7. Outlier Detection in EDA**

Techniques:

### **Z-score**

[
z_i = \frac{X_i - \mu}{\sigma}
]

### **IQR**

[
\text{Outlier if } X_i < Q1 - 1.5 \cdot IQR \text{ or } X_i > Q3 + 1.5 \cdot IQR
]

### **Visualization**

* Boxplot
* Scatter plot
* Distribution plot

Outliers can indicate:

* Data entry errors
* Rare but legitimate events
* Potential anomalies or fraud

---

| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |

# **9. EDA Workflow (Step-by-Step)**

A typical EDA pipeline includes:

### **Step 1: Data Overview**

* Inspect structure (rows × columns)
* Data types
* Head/tail of dataset

### **Step 2: Data Quality Checks**

* Missing values
* Duplicates
* Data type mismatches
* Inconsistent values

### **Step 3: Univariate Analysis**

* Distribution of each numerical feature
* Category counts for categorical features

### **Step 4: Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**

* Feature relationships
* Scatterplots, correlations, cross-tabs

### **Step 5: Outlier Analysis**

* Boxplots
* Z-scores or IQR rules

### **Step 6: Feature-Type Summary**

* Identify numerical, categorical, text, date features
* Plan preprocessing and encoding

### **Step 7: Insights & Hypotheses**

* Potential drivers of target variable
* Early signs of feature importance
* Modeling strategy suggestions

# **10. Example: EDA for House Price Dataset**

Features:

* Size (sqft) — numerical
* Bedrooms — numerical
* City — categorical
* Price — numerical (target)

EDA steps:

1. **Histograms** → price is right-skewed
2. **Boxplot by city** → major differences by location
3. **Correlation heatmap** → size strongly correlates with price
4. **Scatterplot** → linear trend between size and price
5. **Check missing values** → 5% missing bedrooms
6. **Outlier Detection** → few extreme luxury houses > 5M
7. **Action plan** → log-transform price, impute bedrooms, handle outliers

---

# **Summary**

EDA combines statistical analysis and visualization to:

* Understand distributions
* Detect outliers
* Measure relationships
* Identify data quality issues
* Guide preprocessing and modeling decisions

A strong EDA reduces modeling errors, improves feature engineering, and ensures robust ML pipelines.
