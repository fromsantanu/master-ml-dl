# ⭐ **Lesson 11: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### *Explained in very simple, everyday language*

Before building a Machine Learning model, we must first **look at the data carefully**.
This step is called **Exploratory Data Analysis**, or **EDA**.

Think of EDA as “getting to know your data” just like you get to know a new friend—
you observe, ask questions, and understand their behaviour.

EDA helps you see:

* What the data looks like
* What problems it has
* What patterns are hidden inside
* What important information you should focus on

Let’s learn this in simple steps.

---

# 👀 **1. What is EDA? (Simple meaning)**

EDA means:

👉 **Taking a good look at your data before using it for ML.**

We explore the data to understand:

* basic trends
* missing values
* outliers (strange values)
* relationships between columns

Just like reading the index of a book before reading the chapters.

---

# 📘 **2. Why is EDA important?**

Because EDA helps us:

### ✔ Spot mistakes

like missing values, duplicates, wrong entries.

### ✔ Understand patterns

like people of a certain age buying a certain product.

### ✔ Know which features are useful

Some columns may help prediction; some may not.

### ✔ Make better decisions

If we understand data well, our ML model will be smarter.

# 🧰 **3. What do we do in EDA? (Simple checklist)**

EDA normally includes these steps:

1. **Look at a few rows**
2. **Check data types**
3. **Find missing values**
4. **Look at summary statistics**
5. **Understand distributions**
6. **Find outliers**
7. **See relationships between features**

Let’s explain each in a simple way.

---

# 📄 **Step 1: Look at a few rows**

We simply view the top 5–10 rows to get a basic idea.

Example:

| Age | Salary | City   |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 25  | 30,000 | Delhi  |
| 32  | 45,000 | Mumbai |
| …   | …      | …      |

This helps us answer:
“What kind of data am I working with?”

---

# 🔍 **Step 2: Check data types**

We check:

* which columns are numerical
* which are categorical
* which are text

This helps us know how to handle each column later.

---

# 🕳️ **Step 3: Find missing values**

We count how many blanks each column has.

Example:

* Age → 3 missing
* Salary → 0 missing
* City → 2 missing

This helps in cleaning the data.

---

# 📊 **Step 4: Summary statistics**

We calculate simple stats like:

* mean
* median
* min/max
* standard deviation

Example for Age:

* Min = 18
* Max = 65
* Mean = 32

These values tell us how the numbers behave.

---

# 🌡️ **Step 5: Understand distributions**

We check how values are spread.

### ✔ Example

Most people’s salaries may be between 25,000 and 50,000.
A few might earn much more — these are outliers.

Plots like **histograms** help us see this.

---

# ⚠️ **Step 6: Identify outliers**

Outliers = values that look “strange”.

Example:

* Most ages: 20–60
* One person with age 200 → outlier
* Salary = 10,00,000 when most earn 20k–60k → outlier

Outliers can mislead ML models, so we need to check them.

---

# 🔗 **Step 7: Check relationships between features**

We see how columns are connected.

Examples:

* Do older people earn more?
* Do people from a certain city spend more?
* Does higher study time lead to better marks?

We often use:

* scatter plots
* correlation heatmaps
* bar charts

These simple visuals reveal hidden patterns.

---

# 👓 **4. Simple analogy — Knowing a new student**

Before helping a new student, a teacher will first:

* look at their previous marks
* check strengths and weaknesses
* understand behaviour
* find areas that need help

EDA does exactly the same thing for data.

---

# 🚀 **5. Why EDA makes ML more accurate**

Because EDA helps you:

* remove errors
* handle missing values
* choose better features
* understand patterns
* prepare the data correctly

A model trained after good EDA will always perform better.

---

# 🌟 **Final takeaway**

EDA is the **first and most important step** in Machine Learning.

It includes:

* viewing the data
* checking data types
* finding missing values
* summarizing with statistics
* spotting outliers
* visualizing patterns
* exploring relationships

EDA helps you understand *the story the data is telling* before training a model.
