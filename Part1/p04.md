# ⭐ **Lesson 4: Numerical vs Categorical vs Text vs Image Data**

### *Explained in very simple, everyday language*

In Machine Learning, data comes in different shapes and forms.
Some data is numbers, some is words, some is long text, and some are images.

To use ML properly, we must understand **what type of data we are dealing with**.
This is important because **each type needs to be handled differently**.

Let’s learn these types in the simplest way.

# 🧮 **1. Numerical Data (Number-based data)**

These are values that are numbers — you can add them, subtract them, or compare them.

### ✔ Examples:

* Age (25, 30, 40)
* Salary (30,000; 50,000)
* Height (170 cm)
* Temperature (28°C)
* Marks (78, 90, 66)

### ✔ Real-life example

Your mobile battery percentage — *50%, 64%, 100%* — is numerical data.

### ✔ Why it is important

ML understands numerical data very well because numbers have clear meaning.

---

# 🏷️ **2. Categorical Data (Group-based data)**

This data represents **categories** or **groups**, not numbers.

### ✔ Examples:

* Gender → Male, Female
* City → Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata
* Colour → Red, Blue, Green
* Yes/No answers
* Types of food → Veg, Non-Veg

You **cannot** add or subtract these values.

### ✔ Real-life example

When you order food online, you choose:

* North Indian
* South Indian
* Chinese
* Italian
  These are categories.

### ✔ Why ML needs special care here

Computers cannot understand words directly.
We must convert categories into numbers using techniques like **encoding** (covered later).

---

# ✍️ **3. Text Data (Sentences or paragraphs)**

Text data includes full sentences, reviews, comments, or any written content.

### ✔ Examples:

* “This movie was amazing!”
* “Delivery was late.”
* “The food was delicious.”

### ✔ Real-life example

Google searches, WhatsApp chats, Amazon reviews — all contain text data.

### ✔ Why text is different

Text has meaning hidden in words.
ML requires special methods (like tokenization) to understand these patterns.

---

# 🖼️ **4. Image Data (Pictures or photos)**

Image data contains **pixels** (tiny dots of colour).
ML does not see an image like humans do — it sees it as numbers.

### ✔ Examples:

* Photos of cats
* Medical X-ray images
* Selfies used for face unlock
* Traffic images for detecting vehicles

### ✔ Real-life example

Your phone’s camera identifies faces by analyzing the image as numbers.

### ✔ Why image data is special

Images are large and complex.
ML uses special models called **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** — don’t worry, we’ll keep it simple when we reach that part.

# 🌈 **Quick Comparison Table**

| Data Type       | Simple Meaning               | Example              | How ML Sees It           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Numerical**   | Numbers that have size/value | Age, marks, salary   | As numbers               |
| **Categorical** | Groups or labels             | City, gender, colour | Converted into numbers   |
| **Text**        | Sentences or words           | Reviews, comments    | Broken into words/tokens |
| **Image**       | Photos                       | Cat picture          | Numbers (pixels)         |

---

# 🎯 **Why does knowing data types matter in ML?**

Because:

* Different data types need **different cleaning methods**
* Different methods are used to **convert them for ML models**
* Some models work better with certain data types

Understanding data types helps you choose the right ML approach later.

---

# 🌟 Final takeaway

Machine Learning handles four main types of data:

* **Numerical** → pure numbers
* **Categorical** → group names
* **Text** → sentences
* **Image** → pictures made of pixels

Once you recognize your data type, you can prepare it correctly for the model.
