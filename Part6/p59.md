# **Lesson 59: Optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSProp)**

*Explained in very simple, everyday language.*

---

When a neural network learns, it keeps adjusting its **weights** and **biases** to reduce mistakes.
But *how* should it adjust them?

Slowly?
Quickly?
In small steps?
In smart steps?

This is decided by something called an **optimizer**.

Think of an optimizer as a **learning style** for the network.

Just like students have different learning styles:

* Some learn slowly but steadily
* Some learn fast
* Some learn with clever shortcuts

Neural networks also have different learning styles.
Here we learn the three most common ones:

1️⃣ **SGD**
2️⃣ **Adam**
3️⃣ **RMSProp**

# ⭐ 1. SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)

### **Easy Analogy: A person walking downhill slowly**

Imagine you are blindfolded and standing on top of a hill.
Your goal is to reach the lowest point (minimum error).

You can:

* Feel the slope
* Take a small step down
* Feel again
* Take another step

Slow but steady.

### That is SGD.

It learns by taking **small steps** in the right direction.

### ✔ Advantages

* Simple
* Good for steady learning

### ✔ Disadvantages

* Slow
* Can get stuck in “small hills” (local minima)

# ⭐ 2. RMSProp

### **Easy Analogy: Adjusting your walking speed depending on the road**

Imagine you are walking downhill again.

* If the ground is rough → you walk slowly
* If the ground is smooth → you walk faster

You keep adjusting your speed depending on the road condition.

### That is RMSProp.

It **automatically slows down or speeds up learning** depending on how the error changes.

### ✔ Advantages

* Faster than SGD
* Does not shake too much

### ✔ Disadvantages

* Little more complex, but you don’t need to worry — it works well for most problems

---

# ⭐ 3. Adam (Most Popular)

### **Easy Analogy: A smart walker using two tools**

Adam behaves like someone who downhill-walks with:

* A map of the slope (memory of past steps)
* Adjustable speed (like RMSProp)

It combines the best ideas of:

* SGD
* Momentum (past memory of movement)
* RMSProp (adjusting speed)

That’s why Adam is very popular.

### ✔ Advantages

* Very fast
* Very stable
* Works well for beginners

### ✔ Disadvantages

* Sometimes over-smart and overshoots (rare with good settings)

# 🎯 When to use what?

| Optimizer   | When to Use                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **SGD**     | When you want simple, slow, steady learning    |
| **RMSProp** | When the problem is tricky and changes a lot   |
| **Adam**    | Best default choice for beginners & most tasks |

Most people start with **Adam**, because it works well without much tuning.

# 💡 One-Line Summary

Optimizers are the *learning styles* of your neural network:

* **SGD = slow walker**
* **RMSProp = speed-adjusting walker**
* **Adam = smart walker with memory + speed control**
