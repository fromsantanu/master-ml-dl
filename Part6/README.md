# **PART 6 — TRAINING NEURAL NETWORKS**

### *Introductory Section (Explained in very simple, everyday language)*

In the earlier parts, you learned what neural networks are and how they work at a basic level.
Now, in **Part 6**, we move one step deeper — we learn **how to actually train a neural network** so that it becomes smart over time.

Think of this like teaching a child:

* At first, the child doesn’t know anything.
* You show examples again and again.
* Slowly, the child makes mistakes.
* You correct those mistakes.
* After many rounds, the child improves.

Training a neural network works in exactly the same way.

In this part, you will learn:

### ⭐ **Lesson 56: Backpropagation (easy analogy)**

We will explain *backpropagation* using simple ideas — like how a student corrects mistakes after seeing their test results.

### ⭐ **Lesson 57: Building your first ANN**

You will understand how to create a small, simple Artificial Neural Network step by step — just like arranging blocks to build something.

### ⭐ **Lesson 58: Batch size, epochs, learning rate**

These are like classroom routines:

* How many examples to show at once
* How many rounds of practice
* How fast or slow the learning should be

Everything will be explained with everyday examples.

### ⭐ **Lesson 59: Optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSProp)**

Optimizers are like different styles of learning — slow learner, fast learner, balanced learner.
You’ll understand them in a very easy way.

### ⭐ **Lesson 60: Regularization — Dropout, L1, L2**

These techniques stop your network from “overthinking” or memorising too much.
We will explain them with simple real-life comparisons.

### ⭐ **Lesson 61: Batch Normalization**

A small trick that helps the network stay steady while learning — like keeping the classroom temperature comfortable so students can focus.

### ⭐ **Lesson 62: Training Tricks — early stopping, callbacks**

These are helpful shortcuts and safety tools that improve training — like a teacher stopping a student when enough practice is done.

By the end of Part 6, you will understand **how to train neural networks in a practical and beginner-friendly way**, and you’ll feel confident to build your own deep learning models.
