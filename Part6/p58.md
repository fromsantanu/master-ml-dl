# **Lesson 58: Batch Size, Epochs, Learning Rate**

*Explained in very simple, everyday language.*

---

When you train a neural network, three small settings decide **how the network learns**.
Think of them like study habits for a student.

These three are:

1️⃣ **Batch Size**
2️⃣ **Epochs**
3️⃣ **Learning Rate**

Let’s understand all three with very simple real-life examples.

---

# 🥤 1. Batch Size — *How many examples you show at once*

Imagine you are teaching a child multiplication tables.

You can do it in two ways:

### **Option A: Teach 1 question at a time**

Like:
2 × 3 = ?
Then check.
Then next question.

### **Option B: Teach 10 questions at a time**

Give a small worksheet of 10 questions, then correct all at once.

This “number of questions per group” is like **batch size**.

### 🔹 In neural networks:

* **Small batch size** = network learns from very few examples at a time
* **Large batch size** = network learns from many examples at once

Common values: **16, 32, 64, 128**

---

# 🕒 2. Epochs — *How many times the network sees the entire dataset*

Imagine you have a notebook with 100 practice questions.

If you practice all 100 questions:

* **One time** → that’s **1 epoch**
* **Ten times** → that’s **10 epochs**

You are revising the same full notebook again and again.

### 🔹 In neural networks:

More epochs = more practice
Fewer epochs = less practice

Too many epochs can make the model memorize (overfit).
Too few epochs can make the model weak (underfit).

Common values: **10, 20, 50, 100**

---

# 🚴‍♂️ 3. Learning Rate — *How big the correction step is*

Imagine you are trying to balance on a bicycle.

If you fall slightly to the left:

* If you correct **slowly and gently**, you stay stable.
* If you correct **too fast**, you fall the other way.
* If you correct **too slowly**, you keep tilting.

This correction speed is like **learning rate**.

### 🔹 In neural networks:

* **High learning rate** → big jumps, learns fast but may become unstable
* **Low learning rate** → slow and steady, but may take long time

Common values:
**0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001**

Small numbers because learning must be gentle.

# 🎯 Summary with a Very Simple Story

Imagine teaching a class of students:

### ✔ Batch size = how many students you teach at once

Small group or big group?

### ✔ Epoch = how many times you repeat the full lesson

One time or multiple times?

### ✔ Learning rate = how fast the students adjust their mistakes

Slow improvement or fast improvement?

These three together decide **how smoothly and how well the neural network learns**.

---

## ⭐ One-Line Summary

Batch size = group size
Epochs = number of full revisions
Learning rate = speed of learning
