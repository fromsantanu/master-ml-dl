# **PART 7 — COMPUTER VISION (INTRODUCTION)**

*Understanding how computers “see” the world*

In our daily life, we use our eyes to understand everything around us—people, objects, colours, shapes, movement, and so on.
Computer Vision is simply the science of teaching computers to “see” and understand pictures or videos just like we do.

Think of it like this:

* When you look at a dog, you instantly know it’s a dog.
* But for a computer, an image is not a “dog.”
* It’s only a huge grid of tiny dots called **pixels** (like tiny coloured tiles).
* Computer Vision teaches machines how to make sense of these dots.

This part of the course will slowly take you from the **very basics** (what is a pixel?) to **modern powerful systems** (like Vision Transformers used by Google and OpenAI).

We will learn everything step-by-step using simple examples, so even if you have never studied images or maths deeply, you will understand easily.

### **What you will learn in Part 7**

#### **Lesson 63: What is an Image? Pixel basics**

You will learn what a pixel is, how images are stored inside a computer, and how computers understand colours.

#### **Lesson 64: Convolution explained simply**

A very easy explanation of how a computer looks at small parts of an image to find patterns like edges, lines, and shapes.

#### **Lesson 65: CNN Architecture**

Understanding how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work—these are the brains behind almost all image recognition systems.

#### **Lesson 66: Building an Image Classifier**

Step-by-step, you will learn how to teach a computer to identify objects from images (like cats, dogs, or fruits).

#### **Lesson 67: Data Augmentation**

How to “expand” your image dataset by flipping, rotating, and changing brightness so your model learns better.

#### **Lesson 68: Transfer Learning (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet)**

Learning how to use powerful pre-trained models instead of training from zero—just like borrowing the intelligence of a trained model.

#### **Lesson 69: Object Detection basics**

How computers not only *recognize* objects but also *locate* them inside an image.

#### **Lesson 70: Vision Transformers (ViT — simple intro)**

A gentle introduction to the newest and most powerful idea in computer vision—the same idea that powers modern LLMs, but used for images.

### **Why Computer Vision is exciting**

Computer Vision powers many things we use today:

* Face unlock in phones
* Self-driving cars detecting roads
* Medical image diagnosis
* CCTV monitoring
* Google Photos auto-tagging
* Barcode scanners
* Industrial robots
* AR filters on Instagram and Snapchat

By the end of this part, you will have a clear, simple, and practical understanding of how all these systems work.
