# **Lesson 68: Transfer Learning (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet)**

*How to use powerful pre-trained models instead of training from scratch*

Training a CNN from zero needs **a huge number of images**, sometimes millions.
Most students, researchers, and even companies do not have such large datasets.

So we use a smarter approach called **Transfer Learning**.

Think of it like borrowing the knowledge of a “super-trained” model.

---

# **1. What is Transfer Learning? (very simple explanation)**

Transfer Learning means:

**“Use a model that is already trained on a huge dataset, and reuse its knowledge for your own problem.”**

It’s like:

* Learning to drive a car after knowing how to ride a bike.
* Or learning a new language using the grammar rules you already know.

The pre-trained model already knows:

* edges
* shapes
* textures
* objects

So we don’t need to teach all of that again.

We only teach it the **final part** — the part that recognises our specific classes.

---

# **2. Why Transfer Learning is useful?**

Because it:

### **1. Saves time**

Training from scratch may take hours or days.
Transfer Learning can take minutes.

### **2. Needs fewer images**

Even 200–500 images can be enough.

### **3. Gives high accuracy**

These models have already learned powerful patterns.

### **4. Easy to implement**

Most libraries give ready-made pre-trained models.

# **3. How Transfer Learning works (simple steps)**

Imagine you want to build a fruit classifier.

### **Step 1:** Take a pre-trained model

Example: MobileNet (trained on 1.2 million images)

### **Step 2:** Remove its original final layer

Because the original model might classify 1000 objects (ImageNet classes).

### **Step 3:** Add your own final layer

For example:

* Apple
* Banana
* Mango

### **Step 4:** Train only the last layer

This is very fast — because most of the model remains unchanged.

# **4. Popular Pre-Trained Models (Explained Simply)**

We will look at three famous ones:

1. **VGG**
2. **ResNet**
3. **MobileNet**

---

## **1. VGG — Simple and Heavy**

Full Name: **Visual Geometry Group Network** (Oxford University)

### **Key idea:**

Stack many convolution layers on top of each other.

### **Why people like VGG?**

* Very simple to understand
* Good accuracy
* Popular for educational learning

### **Problem:**

* Very heavy
* Slow
* Takes lots of memory

Think of VGG like an old, powerful desktop PC — strong, but not lightweight.

---

## **2. ResNet — Uses “Shortcut Connections”**

Full Name: **Residual Network** (Microsoft)

### **Key idea:**

ResNet adds “shortcuts” that skip some layers.

This solves the problem of models getting confused when they become too deep.

### **Why ResNet is great?**

* Very high accuracy
* Can be extremely deep (50, 101, 152 layers)
* Very stable

Imagine a long staircase where you have shortcuts to skip a few steps — you avoid getting tired.

---

## **3. MobileNet — Light and Fast**

Designed for **mobile phones** and **low-power devices**

### **Key idea:**

Use “depthwise separable convolutions” (don’t worry, this just means it does less work).

### **Why MobileNet is popular?**

* Very small size
* Very fast
* Works well even on weak hardware
* Perfect for real-time apps

Think of MobileNet like a lightweight scooter — fast, useful, and easy to run.

# **5. Which model should you choose? (Simple Guide)**

| Situation                           | Best Model              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| You want the simplest to understand | **VGG**                 |
| You need high accuracy              | **ResNet**              |
| You want speed and small size       | **MobileNet**           |
| You are training on a laptop        | **MobileNet or ResNet** |
| You are working on mobile apps      | **MobileNet**           |

---

# **6. Small Code Example (Very Simple)**

Example: Using MobileNet as the base model.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(3, activation='softmax')(x)   # 3 classes

model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Freeze base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False
```

This example:

* Loads MobileNetV2
* Removes the top
* Adds our custom layers
* Freezes the old layers

Now you train only the new part.

---

# **7. Summary (super simple words)**

* Transfer Learning = use a pre-trained model instead of training from scratch.
* Saves time, gives high accuracy, and needs fewer images.
* VGG = simple but heavy.
* ResNet = deep and powerful.
* MobileNet = fast and lightweight.
* You keep the base model and train only the final layers.
