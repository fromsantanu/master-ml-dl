# **Lesson 69: Object Detection Basics**

*How a computer finds **what** an object is and **where** it is in an image*

So far, you learned how image classification works.
Classification only answers one question:

### **“What is in this image?”**

But in real life, we often need more.

* Where is the person in the photo?
* How many dogs are there?
* Where is the traffic signal?
* Which area contains the car?

This is where **Object Detection** comes in.

Object Detection answers two questions:

1. **What** objects are present?
2. **Where** are they located?

Let’s make this super simple.

---

# **1. Why classification is not enough**

Imagine a picture of a street with:

* 2 cars
* 1 dog
* 3 people

An image classifier might say:

**“This image contains: car, dog, person.”**

But it cannot tell:

* Where the cars are
* Which shape belongs to the dog
* How many people are present

Object detection does all of this.

---

# **2. The idea behind object detection (simple)**

Object detection works by placing a **box** around each object.

This box is called a **bounding box**.

If the computer finds a cat, it draws a box around the cat and labels it “Cat”.

Example:

```
[Cat]
 ---------
|         |
|   🐱    |
|         |
 ---------
```

Each object has its own box.

---

# **3. What information does a bounding box contain?**

A bounding box is defined by 4 numbers:

* **x** → horizontal position
* **y** → vertical position
* **width**
* **height**

Together, these tell the computer where the object is located.

---

# **4. Two main tasks in object detection**

Object detection has to do two things:

### **1. Locate** the object

(Find the coordinates of the box)

### **2. Classify** the object

(Identify whether it is a dog, cat, person, etc.)

So it is basically:

> **Classification + Localization**

---

# **5. How object detection works (super simple idea)**

Think of a computer scanning an image with small windows, like sliding a magnifying glass.

At each location, it checks:

* “Is there an object here?”
* “What object is this?”
* “Where exactly is it?”

Modern techniques use much faster and smarter ways (not literally sliding), but the idea is the same.

---

# **6. Types of Object Detection Methods**

There are two broad families:

---

## **1. Two-Stage Detectors**

*(More accurate but slower)*

Example: **Faster R-CNN**

### How it works:

* Stage 1: Propose possible regions where objects might be
* Stage 2: Classify each region

Think of it like:

1. First finding interesting areas in the picture
2. Then checking what each area contains

Very accurate, used in high-quality applications.

---

## **2. One-Stage Detectors**

*(Fast and good for real-time, like CCTV)*

Examples:

* **YOLO** (You Only Look Once)
* **SSD** (Single Shot Detector)

### How it works:

They look at the whole image in one go and directly output:

* All boxes
* All labels

Very fast — good for cameras, mobile, robots.

YOLO is extremely popular.

---

# **7. Real-life examples of object detection**

Object detection powers many things we see daily:

### **1. Self-driving cars**

Detect pedestrians, vehicles, signals.

### **2. CCTV monitoring**

Detect intruders or suspicious movement.

### **3. Medical imaging**

Detect tumors or abnormalities.

### **4. Retail**

Counting people in a shop.

### **5. Smartphone cameras**

Detect faces for focusing.

### **6. Sports analytics**

Track players, balls, movements.

---

# **8. Why object detection is harder than classification**

Because the model must:

* Find multiple objects
* Predict multiple boxes
* Identify different classes
* Handle varying sizes
* Handle overlapping objects

It’s like solving many classification problems at once.

---

# **9. A tiny code example (just to give an idea)**

Using YOLOv5 in Python:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov5s.pt")
results = model("street_photo.jpg")

results.show()  # draws bounding boxes
```

This automatically detects all objects and draws boxes around them.

---

# **10. Summary (super simple words)**

* Object detection tells both **what** an object is and **where** it is.
* It uses **bounding boxes** to mark objects.
* Two-stage models (e.g., Faster R-CNN) → more accurate.
* One-stage models (e.g., YOLO, SSD) → faster.
* Used in CCTV, cars, medical images, mobile cameras, and many real-life systems.
