# **Lesson 63: What is an Image? (Pixel Basics)**

*Understanding images in the simplest possible way*

When we look at a picture, we see faces, objects, colours, and scenes.
But for a computer, a picture is **not** a dog, a tree, or a building.

For a computer, an image is nothing more than a big grid of tiny coloured dots.

These tiny dots are called **pixels**.

## **1. What is a Pixel?**

A **pixel** is the smallest unit of an image.
Think of a pixel like a tiny coloured tile on a mosaic wall.

If you stand very close to a mosaic, you can only see small coloured squares.
But when you step back, all these squares together form a proper picture.

That is exactly how computers store images.

## **2. How are images stored?**

Imagine an image is like a spreadsheet:

* Each **cell** = one pixel
* Each pixel has a **colour value**
* Putting thousands of pixels together forms an image

A small image might be **100 × 100 pixels**
A phone camera image might be **4000 × 3000 pixels**

So a higher number of pixels = clearer image.

## **3. How do pixels store colour?**

Computers usually store colour using the **RGB model**:

* **R** = Red
* **G** = Green
* **B** = Blue

These 3 colours mix together (just like mixing paints) to create all other colours.

For example:

* Pure Red = (255, 0, 0)
* Pure Green = (0, 255, 0)
* Pure Blue = (0, 0, 255)
* White = (255, 255, 255)
* Black = (0, 0, 0)
* Yellow = (255, 255, 0)

Each pixel stores 3 numbers: R, G, and B.
That’s it!

---

## **4. Grayscale images (Black & White)**

Some images don’t use colour at all.
They only store **brightness** (how light or dark the pixel is).

So one pixel has just **one value** between 0 and 255:

* 0 → black
* 255 → white
* Middle values → different shades of grey

This makes grayscale images simpler and often easier for beginners to work with.

## **5. Example to visualize pixels**

Let’s say we zoom into a picture of a cat’s face.
At normal view: we see a smooth image.
When zoomed very close: we see many tiny squares—each square a different colour.

Those squares are pixels.

---

## **6. Why are pixels important in Computer Vision?**

Because when we build a machine learning model for images, we are basically asking the model to:

**“Look at all these pixel values and identify patterns.”**

For example:

* Edges
* Lines
* Curves
* Shapes
* Colours
* Textures

Everything starts with pixels.

---

## **7. Real-life example**

Think about colouring a drawing using small squares on graph paper.

* If the squares are big, the drawing looks rough.
* If the squares are tiny, the drawing looks smooth and detailed.

Images work exactly the same way.

---

## **8. Summary (Very Simple)**

* An image is made of **pixels** (tiny dots).
* A pixel stores **colour values** using RGB.
* Grayscale images store only brightness.
* More pixels = clearer image.
* Computer Vision models learn patterns by analysing pixel values.
