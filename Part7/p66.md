# **Lesson 66: Building an Image Classifier**

*Teaching a computer to recognise objects from images (step-by-step, very simple)*

In the previous lessons, you learned how CNNs “see” patterns in images.
Now we will use that knowledge to build a simple **Image Classifier**.

An **image classifier** is a program that looks at a picture and says:

* “This is a cat.”
* “This is a dog.”
* “This is a mango.”
* “This is a car.”

It learns this by looking at many example images.

Let’s understand the whole process in very simple steps.

---

# **1. What is an Image Classifier?**

It is a model that takes an image and predicts a **label**, like:

* Cat
* Dog
* Shoe
* Tomato
* Person

To do this, the model must first **learn** from many images.

This learning process is called **training**.

---

# **2. What do we need to build an image classifier?**

We need only three things:

### **1. Images**

(For example, many pictures of cats and dogs)

### **2. Labels**

Each image must have the correct name like “cat" or “dog”.

### **3. A CNN Model**

This model will learn the patterns from the images.

---

# **3. Step-by-step: How the classifier learns**

Let’s say you want to train a model to identify **cats and dogs**.

### **Step 1: Give training images**

Feed the model many cat pictures and tell it:
“This is a cat.”

Feed dog pictures and say:
“This is a dog.”

### **Step 2: The CNN finds patterns**

It learns things like:

* Cat ears are pointy
* Dog snout is longer
* Cat eyes shape
* Dog fur pattern

It doesn't know these as “cat ears" or “dog fur,”
but it sees them as patterns in pixels.

### **Step 3: Model adjusts itself**

If the model makes a mistake, it changes its internal settings (weights) to improve.

This is like a student learning from mistakes.

### **Step 4: After training, it starts recognising**

Now the model can see a new image (that it has never seen before) and say:

“Looks like a **dog** with 90% confidence.”

# **4. The layers used inside the classifier**

You already learned these:

1. **Convolution layers** → find small patterns
2. **Pooling layers** → keep only important details
3. **Flatten layer** → convert patterns to a list
4. **Fully Connected layers** → combine everything and decide the label

This is the skeleton of almost every image classifier.

---

# **5. How the classifier is trained (simple example)**

Imagine training the model with these images:

* 1000 cat photos
* 1000 dog photos

During training:

* The model tries to guess each image
* If it guesses wrong, it corrects itself
* After thousands of corrections, it becomes accurate

This is similar to how a child learns:

* See many cats and dogs
* Make mistakes
* Slowly learn the difference

---

# **6. Testing the model**

After training, we check if the model is good by showing images it has never seen.

If it identifies them correctly, we know the model works.

---

# **7. Building a simple classifier in code (super tiny example)**

*(This is just to give an idea — no complicated details)*

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')   # cat vs dog
])
```

This example shows a small CNN model.

* First layers: find patterns
* Last layers: make decisions

---

# **8. How the model predicts**

When we give a new image:

1. The CNN extracts patterns
2. The fully connected layer calculates scores
3. The softmax layer chooses the label with the highest score

Example:

```
cat → 0.92
dog → 0.08
```

The model says: **Cat**

---

# **9. Real-life uses of image classification**

* Face recognition
* Detecting plant diseases
* Reading X-ray or MRI scans
* Identifying animals in wildlife
* Sorting products in factories
* Filtering harmful content online

Image classification is everywhere today.

---

# **10. Summary (very simple words)**

* An image classifier learns from many labelled images.
* CNN layers find patterns like edges, shapes, and textures.
* Fully connected layers decide the final label.
* After training, the model can recognise new images.
